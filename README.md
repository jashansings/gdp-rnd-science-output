## 📘 Overview

This project investigates the relationship between **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** and **Research & Development (R&D) Expenditure** across more than 150 countries. It applies data science and visualization techniques to explore how national investment in innovation correlates with economic performance.

Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and correlation mapping, the notebook delivers actionable insights for economists, policy-makers, and data analysts.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and structure global GDP–R&D datasets
- Perform EDA to extract meaningful economic trends
- Identify correlations between R&D intensity and GDP growth
- Visualize trends using clean, publication-ready charts

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation
  - `numpy` – for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` – for static plotting
  - `seaborn` – for statistical visualization

---

## 💡 Key Highlights

- Cleaned macroeconomic data for **150+ countries**
- Uncovered trends between **R&D investment** and **GDP performance**
- Used **correlation heatmaps**, **scatter plots**, and **trend lines** for storytelling
- Structured and documented code for reproducibility

---

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- 📊 GDP trend line graphs (by continent/region)
- 🔥 Heatmaps showing correlation between R&D intensity and GDP per capita
- 🌍 Scatter plots comparing R&D spending vs GDP growth
